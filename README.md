# Home_Security_System
A security system for my home!

This is a security system I am making for my home. It will consist of several wireless Arduino Pro Minis acting as sensor nodes
using PIR motion sensors, magnetic switches, a siren, microphones, and maybe an RF ID reader as the arm/disarm mechanism.

Uses tmrh20's fork of ManiacBug's NRF library for the wireless mechanisms (since XBee is so super expensive).
